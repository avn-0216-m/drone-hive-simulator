pickup code should be on drone script because items do not "know" how to be picked up, a drone knows how to pick items up.
should be called "selected" instead of "primed"
inventory should not know what items the drone is looking at/standing in front of. the drone should know that.
"if item is pickup, [pickup code here]"
pickups should have a source (to go with the infinite var) so items other than themselves can be picked up (such as spoons from a drawer)

# TODO: STOP HANDLING THE INVENTORY VIA THE DRONE
# DELETE THIS
# THE INVENTORY SHOULD BE A SELF CONTAINED OBJECT
